# OS-Project
USER LEVEL THREAD LIBRARY
The goal of this project is to implement a basic thread system for Linux. The
goal of a thread subsystem is to provide applications that want to use threads a
set of library functions (an interface) that the application can use to create and
start new threads, terminate threads, or manipulate threads in different ways.
I will implement a cooperative User Level Thread (ULT) library for Linux
that can replace the default PThreads library.
